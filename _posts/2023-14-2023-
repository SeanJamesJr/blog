The Titanic was part of the one of the most iconic tragedies of all time. RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship that hit an iceberg on her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States with a death total of 1,496 a true tragedy and one that is still present in todays society with even a movie being made on it. In class we were  provided with a dataset that contained different things about the passengers from the titanic such as for example PassengerId, there class name sex age if they survived or not and other things. 
       


    Based on this data we had to make 3 questions which we would answer using pandas an open-source software library used for data manipulation and analysis.My first question I developed was to find out the amount of men vs women in each class .To answer this question i created a variable called data1  which collects each columns info then counts it to see the number of men and women in each class.

    data1 = df.groupby(["Pclass","Sex"])['Survived'].count() 

    I then ploted data1 onto a graph which showed all the information of specifically what i needed the class, Sex and Survived.

    The data presented in the graph reveals men were most of the passengers on the ship in each class had more  men then woman in each
