todo or not todo i was forced todo the todo project. Very poetic i know shakespeare is jealous. This week in class we recreated our old todo project but this time in python. We also removed almost everything we had in the javacscript version.  Something we did different this time also was we used an infinite while loop so that the todo runs infinietly. Heres a snippet of it to look at.
while True:
really simple huh I didnt think it was gonna be this easy either. we also did the decicisions to add or remove  a item from the list to. More snippets here:

	
 	```
    decision=input('add or remove')
    # adds a item to the list
    if (decision == 'add'): 
        addTodo=input(' What is your new todo ')
        todos.append(addTodo)

        elif (decision == 'remove'):
        RemoveTodo=input('enter word here to remove from Todo list')
        todos.remove(RemoveTodo)
        print(todos)
 		```

But to end of this was preety different from the last Todo we did and bresh of fresh air from the usually challenging task that we have.


My fellow coders im thinking of a abbreveation JS right now, u might be thinking o hes thinking about javascript?WRONG im thinking about a delecious jerk salmon that my grandmother made this week that reminded me of the difference between my todo projects one havibg to deal with Js and one dealing with strictly Python. The salmon was preety nice for some reason my granbma saying it wasnt good but to me it wasfinger licking delecious. served with some rice and veggies the jerk salmon was so far the highlight meal of my week and reminded me of one of my old projects from last Junior year.
