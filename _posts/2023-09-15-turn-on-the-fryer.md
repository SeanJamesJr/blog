Good morning ladies and gentelman. This is my first post of my blog and the start of a very interesting adventure.In these Blogs i will speak about my  current coding projects what i have learned and how i can use it in my future. i'll also talk about senior year and whats going on in my life. What im gonna do also since this is also a food blog is talk about a meal i recently had.

First meal first blog we will be talking about what I had for lunch yesterday we are rating the STEAM Center pizza. Under the seam center is a walk-through place where a few food places sit. One of them being a pizza place. They serve lots of diiferent pizzas that I am to lazy to learn the name of. They make them all in electrical stone oven. Now onto the slice; I think it was a vodka slice and i got 2 seasoned it with garlic, pepper, red peper flakes hot sauce and honey glaze. The combination was preety good and you could taste the tomato sauce and the strong cheese taste. The crust was preety good nice and soft. But it wasnt hot how i like it with the cheese bubbling  so in the end it was a 6.5 not bad but could be better.
