Introduction

Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features. what makes Flask different from HTML and CSS is that it is Lightweight and minimalistic.Flask has very few dependencies and provides only the essential components for web development, such as routing, request handling, templating, and testing. This makes Flask easy to learn and use, and also gives you more flexibility and control over your application. An additional language that flask uses is jinja. Jinja is  a web template engine for the Python programming language. It is the most popular template engine for python and   projects and is used in projects like Flask, Django, and Ansible.

 
 Resources
 
 A rescource I used to help me learn Flask and debug issues was Mr.Forlenza. Everythime I had gotten an error or was stuck he showed me what was wrong and helped correct it with me so I understood what I had to. A rescource that I found that I feel would have been valubale/helpul would be the Flask documentation. It holds everything I need to know about flask and is definetly a amazing resource. Some challegnges I faced while learning flask was remebering specifically what I needed to import when using flask in my code.
 
 
 Challenges & Learnings
 
  One of the main problems I had was intergating my database from php my admin into my website. At first it was kinda confusings nut after a while I figured it out and was fine. Another problem that I had while using flask was signing into my user login. I kept on getting erros about my attributes and I had to keep on checking them to make sure that they were how they were in the database but when I matched them to it, the code worked fine and signed me in with no problems. 
  
 
 Social Media Project
 
  For my social media Flask project I built my website called The New Place. It includes  a feed page. So far the functionalities  it includes are signing in signining up and posting. Some things that I learned from this project is that I am able to post from the database which I wasnt aware was possible. Some other learning experinces I have is from using CSS on the bootsrap website styles and figuring out how use it and make my website have the style that I think fits its theme.
